A set of tools for Css Battle, directly in the battle interface.

Features :

- Prettify your code (with prettier)
- Display a grid on your code output
- Display the target on your code output
- A tool to find shorter css unit (int√©gration of https://u9kels.csb.app/)
- A tool to find shorter css color in hexa (mix of https://48dvyq.csb.app/ and https://codepen.io/SelenIT/pen/JaeYpM)
- Print, on the fly, the number of characters your code should be once minified

It's a first version. Nothing is configurable, for now.
Minification and prettification work well with code style like :

```html
<!-- Some html -->

  // Some css
<style>
```
